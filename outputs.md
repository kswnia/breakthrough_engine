🔍 GOAL:

Get a clear, objective map of where your energy is going, where you're stagnant, and where the truth is being avoided or blurred.

I'll ask direct, personalized questions across key life and business areas. I want you to respond clearly and specifically. I will challenge fluff or avoidance.

After each section, I’ll extract data and save into CSV format for analysis. Let’s go.
🧠 MENTAL & EMOTIONAL ENERGY:

    Where do you feel most mentally exhausted on a weekly basis? Be precise (task, person, environment).

    What thoughts loop most often in your mind? (Be specific: doubts, regrets, "shoulds", fantasies, etc.)

    What are you pretending is fine, but deep down know it’s not?

    When was the last time you had real clarity and drive? What changed since then?

💼 WORK / BUSINESS:

    What specific activity in your work/business feels like it takes a lot but gives little in return?

    What are you still doing out of fear that if you stop, something will collapse?

    Where are you tolerating inefficiency or confusion instead of confronting it head-on?

    What part of your business are you avoiding optimizing or rethinking?

🕯 PERSONAL LIFE:

    What relationships drain you but you're still maintaining? Why?

    Where are you overgiving, overexplaining, or overcompensating?

    What are you compromising that you deeply don’t want to compromise anymore?

    What’s something you're doing because it used to work — but no longer does?

🔁 LOOP & REPEAT CYCLES:

    Name one behavior you keep repeating, even though it gets you poor results.

    What pattern have people close to you pointed out multiple times?

    What area of your life feels like a Groundhog Day loop?
